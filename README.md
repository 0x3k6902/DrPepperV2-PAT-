# DrPepperV2-PAT-


This is project pat v2 (dr pepper repo) just for easier access as now im releasing it in a table

Only the anti dump is "protected" with lua obfuscator just cos i dont wanna spoon feed so hard and gotta keep something shit devs maybe cant figure out on their own

I will release fully open source soon when i cancel it other than that PAT (public anti tamper) has been running for awhile and is great for starter projects!
